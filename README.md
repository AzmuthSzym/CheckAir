# CheckAir

This simple app uses https://openweathermap.org/ api in order to get the current air pollution data for the location specified by the user.
To use it you can download the repository, change the "my_APIkey" variable in App.py file to your key and then run the file.

For the future I have two big features planned:
  1. Use tkinter library to create GUI for the app - DONE
  2. Make location inputs more user-friendly - users will not have to specify longitude and latitude. Instead they will be able to put in the name of the desired location, which is more convenient
